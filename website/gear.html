				<table>
<tr>
<td><img class="smaller" src="Image/Helmet.jpg" alt="Helmet" /></td>
<td>Though not enforced, most all trails require riders to wear
          helmets. Be sure to swing by your local bike shop to pick up
          a stylish, certified helmet!
        </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img class="smaller" src="Image/Tube.jpg" alt="Tube" /></td>
<td>Let's face it, flats are inevitable on the rugged off road course.
        Be prepared with a spare tube to keeping you rolling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img class="smaller" src="Image/Pump.jpg" alt="Pump" /></td>
<td>What use is a spare tube without a pump? A compact pump such as the one
        pictured fits snug on the bicycle and if (and when)you have a flat,
        or just experience a loss of air, you can be prepared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img class="smaller" src="Image/FirstAid.jpg" alt="FirstAid" /></td>
<td>Everyone thinks riding a bicycle is simple, but let's face it, off road
        mountain biking features steep inclines and drops, with scattered roots, rocks,
        and even critters on the trail. Prepare for the worst with a basic compact first
        aid kit. Suggested materials are: alcohol sanitizer, bandages and wraps, and 
        snake venom medication.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img class="smaller" src="Image/Camel.jpg" alt="Camel" /></td>
<td>				Always remember to stay hydrated while on the trail! Mountain biking
        is a strenuous activity and much water can be excreted from the body in
        the form of sweat. Always take plenty of water with you when you ride, 
        atleast two liters, and maybe more if you choose to make the ride an all 
        day event. A camel back such as the one pictured is handy as it allows 
        the rider to maintain their hydration, without slowing down the pace and 
        also allows for storage of tools and snacks.</td>
